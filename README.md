# How to design chips for Machine Learning

This book aims to explain fundamentals of machine learning hardware starting with the model architectures all the way to packaging and deployment in a datacenter. We try to use various contemporary chip architectures throughout the book and reason about the choices involved. We lean on some great resources for many of the topics when available. This book should ideally be approachable and helpful to architects and hardware engineers working in this space to build intuition of the bigger picture. The content might feel simplistic compared to the great one-off articles/blog that you can find in the semiconductor/analyst spheres but the idea here is to go breadth first. The book is available at https://ml-chips.github.io
